It's destructive, I know,
But I miss those nights,
Where the stars are,
The only thing you can show.

And though I may miss,
Another morning,
I know, it's just a hiss,

But without them,
Life would be cruel and boring.
Some would say soaring too,
Pushing problems away,
But I don't see them,
Do you?!

And thus I sit here,
Alone,
In the dark,
Searching,
For another question,
To ask.
